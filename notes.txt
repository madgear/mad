Set this property to "Yes."Also, make sure the "Allow Value List Edits" property is set to "No."By setting "Limit To List" to "Yes" and "Allow Value List Edits" to "No," you restrict users from typing or editing text directly in the combo box. They will only be able to select values from the predefined list.Save your form, and in Form View, the combo box should allow selections from the list but not direct text editing.
